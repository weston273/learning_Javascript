// problem with the above code

//Problem 1: "I'm calling greetUser("Weston") at the end, but   geetUser is defined inside the callback and not available outside.
//Problem 2: You're closing readline immediately after defining the question, which doesn't give it time to wait for the user to answer.

// âœ” Correct cleaned up version

const readline = require("readline").createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output:process.stdout,

const greetUser = name => {
    return `Hello, ${name}. Welcome back` // tips from a senior dev => use only backticks (`) when injecting a variable to use ($) or writing multi-line strings
    // ðŸ§  Memory trick => Backticks bring in the backstage crew - variables sneak in behind the curtains.
