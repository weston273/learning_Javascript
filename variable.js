let name = "wendy" // let is a newer way of declaring variables, you can change the variable later if you want to
const age = 12 // You cannot change this data type
var Job = "farmer" // old school way of declaring a variable, its best if you change it.

// We have many Data types :
// 1. string e.g "hello"
//2. boolean e.g true or false
//3. Array e.g [1,2,3,4,5]
//4. Object e.g {name: "wendy", age: 12} => almost like a dictionary in python which stores data in key value pairs
//5. Then we have the Null/Undefined

// âœ” Task:

let myName = "Weston"; // declaring a variable in form of a  string
let Age = 25; // declaring a variable in form of a number(integer)
let isStudent = true; // variable in form a boolean

console.log(myName, Age, isStudent)
